# -Data-Structure-Challenges

This repository contains implementations of data structure challenges from the Kodeco Book (Data Structures & Algorithms in Dart).

## Implemented Challenges

### Stack Challenges
1. **Reverse a List**: A function that prints the contents of a list in reverse order.
2. **Balance the Parentheses**: A function that checks if parentheses in a string are balanced.

### Linked List Challenges
1. **Print in Reverse**: A function that prints the nodes of a linked list in reverse order.
2. **Find the Middle Node**: A function that finds the middle node of a linked list.
3. **Reverse a Linked List**: A function that reverses a linked list by manipulating the nodes.
4. **Remove All Occurrences**: A function that removes all occurrences of a specific element from a linked list.

## Implementation Details

### Stack Implementation
- Generic Stack class with basic operations (push, pop, peek)
- Uses a List as internal storage
- Includes isEmpty and length properties

### Linked List Implementation
- Generic Node and LinkedList classes
- Supports basic operations (push, append)
- Includes helper methods for node traversal

## Source Material
Challenges are based on the following chapters from Kodeco's Data Structures & Algorithms in Dart book:
- Basic Data Structures in Dart
- Stacks
- Linked Lists
